## Sports

I love to play various indoor and outdoor sports but I prefer playing outdoor games mostly because while playing those games I can enjoy the game and also physical activity can also be done which makes me energetic. I love Cricket,Kabaddi,Football and Badminton. All these sports can be only played in groups only which improves teamwork too.
