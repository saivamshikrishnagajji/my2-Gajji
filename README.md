###### My favourite vacation spot is Manali

Manali, in **Himachal Pradesh**, India, is a stunning hill station nestled in the Kullu Valley. It's famed for its snow-capped peaks, lush meadows, and the pristine **Beas River**. Manali offers diverse outdoor activities, from trekking in Solang Valley to exploring **Hadimba Temple**. With a pleasant climate year-round, it's a magnet for winter sports enthusiasts during snowfall. Additionally, it serves as a gateway to Rohtang Pass and Leh-Ladakh, drawing nature lovers and adventurers to the Himalayan paradise.

## Sports

I love to play various indoor and outdoor sports but I prefer playing outdoor games mostly because while playing those games I can enjoy the game and also physical activity can also be done which makes me energetic. I love Cricket,Kabaddi,Football and Badminton. All these sports can be only played in groups only which improves teamwork too.
