###### My favourite vacation spot is Manali

Manali, in **Himachal Pradesh**, India, is a stunning hill station nestled in the Kullu Valley. It's famed for its snow-capped peaks, lush meadows, and the pristine **Beas River**. Manali offers diverse outdoor activities, from trekking in Solang Valley to exploring **Hadimba Temple**. With a pleasant climate year-round, it's a magnet for winter sports enthusiasts during snowfall. Additionally, it serves as a gateway to Rohtang Pass and Leh-Ladakh, drawing nature lovers and adventurers to the Himalayan paradise.
